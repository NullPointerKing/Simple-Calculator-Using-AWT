# 🧮 Simple Calculator Using Java AWT

## 📋 Introduction
This project is a simple calculator developed using Java's Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT). The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with additional functionalities like square root, percentage, modulus, and negation.

## ✨ Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** ➕ Addition, ➖ Subtraction, ✖️ Multiplication, ➗ Division.
- **Additional Operations:** √ Square Root, 📊 Percentage, 📏 Modulus, 🔄 Negation.
- **User Interface:** AWT-based GUI with buttons for digits and operations, and a text field for display.
- **Error Handling:** Basic error handling for division by zero.

## 🛠️ Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-calculator-java-awt.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd simple-calculator-java-awt
    ```
3. **Compile the Java file:**
    ```bash
    javac Calculator.java
    ```
4. **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    java Calculator
    ```

## 🚀 Usage
1. **Launch the calculator:**
    - Execute the `java Calculator` command to open the calculator GUI.
2. **Perform calculations:**
    - Use the buttons to enter numbers and select operations.
    - Click `=` to get the result.
    - Use `Clr` to clear the display and `Del` to delete the last entered character.
    - Use `√` for square root, `%` for percentage, `Mod` for modulus, and `+/-` for negation.

## ⚙️ Working
The calculator uses Java AWT for the GUI and event handling. The main components are:
- **TextField:** For displaying input and results.
- **Buttons:** For digits, operations, and functionalities.
- **ActionListener:** For handling button clicks and performing calculations.

### 📚 Example Calculation
1. **Addition:**
    - Enter `2`, click `+`, enter `3`, click `=`. Result: `5`.
2. **Square Root:**
    - Enter `9`, click `√`. Result: `3`.

## ✅ Advantages
- Simple and easy-to-use interface.
- Lightweight and quick execution.
- Demonstrates basic concepts of Java AWT and event handling.

## ⚠️ Disadvantages
- Limited to basic arithmetic operations.
- Lacks advanced mathematical functions.
- Basic error handling and simple UI design.

## 🔮 Future Scope
- **UI Improvements:** Enhance the graphical interface for a better user experience.
- **Advanced Features:** Include more mathematical functions (e.g., trigonometric functions, logarithms).
- **Error Handling:** Improve error handling for invalid inputs and operations.
- **Portability:** Make the application available on different platforms (e.g., mobile devices).

## 🏁 Conclusion
This simple calculator project serves as a foundational exercise in using Java AWT for GUI development and understanding basic event handling and arithmetic operations. It provides ample opportunities for further development and enhancement.
